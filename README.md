# myOdonto

## Description

MyOdonto is a mobile application designed to help facilitate the communication between patients and dentists from an Odontological clinic. First, the patient creates a profile with basic information and health insurance type. Then, he is able to schedule an appointment with the desired dentist. The clinic system receives a notification of the appointment and the patient's profile. After every treatment, the patient can visualize in the odontogram and at the Treatments tab all the treatments he has done so far, and share this information with other doctors.

The application was developed using Qml and C++ under the Qt Creator IDE.
MyOdonto was designed by [Ludmila Meireles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludmila-barros-meireles-71402881/) as an internship project, under the guidance and supervision of [Arthur Turrini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-turrini-11a707210/) at [Infr4 Tecnologia.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/infr4/about/)
